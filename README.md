# All Finxx code running by R-studio with R-version 4.1.2
## Code 1 is for distribution plot and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. you need to change directory to your data directory when re-running.
## Code 2 needs r package "survival", "survminer"
## Code 3 needs r package "forestplot"
## Code 4 is for differential expression analysis. glm.nb means Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Model based on genomic data at mean-by-clinicID level (r package MASS/ https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/MASS/versions/7.3-58.1/topics/glm.nb). lmer is linear mixed model running on ROI-segment level data. r package lme4, lmerTest needed.
## Code 5 is to find correlations. r function cor.test was adopted (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/cor.test).
